### 2.2 Plan for the project. 

1. Activity description : we work on the artifacts : DesignDocument.md,ExtraRequirements.md,ProjectPlan.md,TestPlan.md,UseCaseModel.md so that we can refer to these artifacts to allocate the resources (who work on what) and implement the system based on the designs and requirements. Then we can exercise our system based on the test plan. During the activity , we may refine the documents produced in 2.1.

2. Entrance criteria : the inputs needed is the requirements' document and the UML diagram produced in 2.1.

3. Exit criteria : artifacts : DesignDocument.md,ExtraRequirements.md,ProjectPlan.md,TestPlan.md,UseCaseModel.md are produced and our team are satisfied of the artifacts.

3. Exit criteria : The implemented system passed all tests.

### 2.4 Deploy the project

1. Activity description : We may deploy our system to an Androids platform to test it. we also clone the project to another directory and than import it to Android studio to test it again. We may refine the documents produced in 2.2 and the system produced in 2.3.

2. Entrance criteria : DesignDocument.md,ExtraRequirements.md,ProjectPlan.md,TestPlan.md,UseCaseModel.md and  a completed and well-tested system are the inputs of the activity.
