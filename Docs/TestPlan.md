# Test Plan


**Author**: \<Team47\>

| Version | Description     |
| --------|:---------------:|
| V1      | Initial version |
| V2      | add unit tests and some functional testings |
| V3      | add functional testings|

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

#### 1.1.1 Unit Testing

*Activities : Each individual functions presented in each use cases will be tested.

*Who will perform : Developer

#### 1.1.2 Integration Testing

*Activities : Examine how individual functions interact with each other, e.g. after adding a specific customer into the system (using addCustomer function), the new added customer achieves the authority to requestLane and checkOut functions.

*Who will perform : Developer && Quality assurance

#### 1.1.3 System Testing

*Activities : Install the App on different android phones, and test all functions that required in the requirement document.

*Who will perform : All members

#### 1.1.4 Regression Testing

*Activities : We will fix bugs/defects discovered in previous testing and then rerun all the tests (Integration Testing,System Testing) again to deliver a high-quality project that fulfils all the requirements .

*Who will perform : All members


### 1.2 Test Selection

1. Developer will use JUnit framework embeded in Android studio to perform the unit testing. 

2. Developer && Quality assurance will use JUnit/Android simulator for the Integration Testing.

3. All Members will use Android simulator/( Install the App on different android phones) to perform the system testing.

4. We may use some Black-box techniques to apply on unit testing, namely Category-Partion to generate the test cases based on the requirement to test functionality and the system.  We may generate a set of test cases for each use case that described in UseCaseModel base on their unique features. 


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

1. We are going to go through the requirements repeatedly to make sure all expected functions are covered in the test cases.

2. We will assess the quality of our test cases by getting all members inspect and review each of them until we all are satisfied with the tests.

3. We will examine whether each of the requirements is implemented by testing the system through Android virtual machine.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

*Describe how bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked.*

1. Bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked by different roles at different phrase (Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing and Regression Testing).

2. Besides the testing, we will inspect the code and make sure all logic flows are implemented by codes with bugs-free.

### 1.5 Technology

*Describe any testing technology you intend to use or build (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).*

1. JUnit framework, which allows us to compare the expected results and actual results easily and discover bugs from the exception messages.

2. Black-box techniques to apply on unit testing, such as Category-Partion, which allows our the easily cover the logic flows of each functional units.

3. Android simulator, which allows we perform system test easily.â€‹
